# Contributing to Maestro

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Maestro. This guide covers everything you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **One supported runtime**: [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code), or [opencode](https://opencode.ai)
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner (optional but recommended)

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josstei/maestro-orchestrate.git
cd maestro-orchestrate
npm install
```

`npm install` installs dependencies only. Local git hook activation is explicit so package, pack, and publish flows do not mutate hook configuration. To activate the repo-local `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, and `pre-push` hooks for this checkout, run:

```bash
npm run install-hooks
```

Equivalent manual command: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

The hooks are best-effort — CI re-validates everything on PR submission and on direct pushes to `main`.

## Key Commands

All commands are available via `just` or `npm`:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `just generate` | Generate all runtime files from `src/` |
| `just test` | Run all tests (unit + transform + integration) |
| `just test-unit` | Run only unit tests |
| `just test-transforms` | Run only transform unit tests |
| `just test-integration` | Run only integration tests |
| `just check` | Generate + verify zero drift (`git diff --exit-code`) |
| `npm run check` | All quality gates: lint, quality, sast, sca, coverage (>= 80%), regression, smoke (also `just gates`) |
| `npm run lint` / `quality` / `sast` / `sca` | Individual gates (eslint, complexity + layer boundaries, eslint-plugin-security, `npm audit`) |
| `npm run coverage` | Full suite under `c8`; fails below 80% lines, statements, functions, or branches |
| `npm run regression` / `smoke` | Integration suite; install + MCP stdio smoke test |
| `just ci` | Full CI equivalent: check + check-layers + test |
| `just dry-run` | Preview changes without writing |
| `just diff` | Show unified diff of pending changes |

Equivalent npm scripts: `npm run generate` or `npm run build`.

## Architecture: Canonical Source and Generated Runtimes

All hand-maintained code lives in `src/`. Everything outside `src/` at the runtime output locations is **generated** by the build pipeline.

**Never hand-edit generated files.** They will be overwritten on the next `just generate`.

| Generated Location | Runtime |
|--------------------|---------|
| `agents/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, `mcp/`, `policies/` (repo root) | Gemini CLI |
| `claude/` | Claude Code |
| `plugins/maestro/` | Codex |
| `qwen/` plus root `qwen-extension.json` and `QWEN.md` | Qwen Code |
| `opencode/` (`opencode/plugins/` is hand-written) | opencode |

The generator pipeline reads `src/manifest.js` and applies transforms from `src/transforms/` to produce runtime-specific output.

## Making Changes

1. **Branch from `main`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/short-description main
   ```

2. **Make your changes in `src/`** — edit only canonical source files.

3. **Regenerate runtime output**:
   ```bash
   just generate
   ```

4. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   just test
   ```

5. **Verify zero drift** — CI enforces that generated output matches what is committed:
   ```bash
   just check
   ```

6. **Commit and push** your branch.

## Semantic Git Conventions

### Branch format

Branch names must use a semantic type prefix. The local `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks enforce this, and the `Commit Message Check` CI workflow validates PR branch names.

```
<type>/<slug>
<namespace>/<type>/<slug>
release/vX.Y.Z
```

Use the same type vocabulary as commit subjects, except release branches use the fixed `release/vX.Y.Z` format. Slugs are lowercase and may contain numbers, dots, underscores, and hyphens. A namespace is allowed for tool or user prefixes such as `codex/`.

Examples that pass:

- `feat/mcp-session-cache`
- `fix/pre-push-range`
- `codex/chore/enforce-git-conventions`
- `release/v1.7.0`

### Subject format

Commit subjects must follow [Conventional Commits 1.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). The local `commit-msg` hook and the `Commit Message Check` CI workflow both enforce this; PR titles are also validated since this repo squash-merges.

```
<type>(<optional-scope>)<!>: <description>
```

| Type | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New user-facing feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `chore` | Housekeeping — config, deps, tooling, generated files |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests |
| `refactor` | Structural change with no behaviour change |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `style` | Formatting only (no code change) |
| `build` | Build system or external dependencies |
| `ci` | CI configuration |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit |
| `release` | Version bump or release prep |

Scope is lowercase and parenthesised — e.g. `(api)`, `(core)`, `(mcp)`, `(generator)`. Append `!` before the colon to mark a breaking change.

Examples that pass:

- `feat(api): add idempotency-key header`
- `fix(core): reject on malformed JSON instead of crashing`
- `chore(deps): bump c8 to ^10.1.4`
- `feat(auth)!: drop legacy session-token support`
- `release: v1.7.0`

Git-generated subjects pass through both hook and CI without rewriting: `Merge ...`, `Revert ...`, `fixup! ...`, `squash! ...`, `amend! ...`.

If the hook rejects a commit, your message body is preserved in `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`:

```bash
git commit --edit --file=.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
```

To rewrite earlier commits already on a branch:

```bash
git rebase -i origin/main    # change 'pick' to 'reword' on each bad commit
```

### Changelog

This project uses [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. When your change is user-facing, add an entry under the `[Unreleased]` section in `CHANGELOG.md` with the appropriate category (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`).

## Pull Request Process

1. Fill out the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
2. Ensure CI passes — the `generator-check` workflow verifies zero drift and runs the full test suite.
3. Link any related issues.
4. A maintainer will review your PR. Address feedback and keep the branch up to date with `main`.

## Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

Use the [issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) to file bug reports or feature requests. Include your runtime (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Codex, Qwen Code, or opencode), Node.js version, and steps to reproduce.

## Code Review

All submissions require review before merging. Reviewers check for:

- Correctness and completeness
- Adherence to the canonical-source architecture
- Test coverage for new or changed behavior
- Zero drift after regeneration
